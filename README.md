# Project
This  is a small work on the Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq).In this project scRNA-seq data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (GSE212966) was included and analyzed comprehensively. scRNA-seq data was processed using Seurat for dimensionality reduction, clustering, and cell annotation, with differential gene expression and functional enrichment analyses performed to identify and characterize cluster-specific genes.A total 20 pair ended samples were taken, which contain 10 samples from tumour condition and 10 samples from adjacent normal pancreatic tissue.
